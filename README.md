### PART A
# Color Detection and Replacement in Mondrian Art
## Overview
This project is a p5.js sketch that manipulates an image inspired by Piet Mondrianâ€™s art. The goal is to detect specific colors (red, yellow, and blue) in the image and replace them dynamically based on user-defined thresholds.
### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was the iconic geometric and primary-colored artwork of Piet Mondrian. The task involved:
### Features
Detecting Key Colors: Red, yellow, and blue were chosen as target colors.
Dynamic Manipulation: Using sliders to adjust thresholds for color detection, making the interaction flexible and user-controlled.
Creative Replacement: Replacing detected colors with:
Red: Replaced with white.
Yellow: Replaced with green.
Blue: Replaced with random colors to add a dynamic effect.

Sliders were implemented to allow real-time adjustment of detection thresholds for red, yellow, and blue.
Each slider's value updated the threshold dynamically, giving users control over the manipulation process.

### PART B

# Mirror Effect Display with Yoko Ono-Inspired Art

## Overview
This project combines the functionality of a live camera feed with a creative mirror effect and Yoko Ono-inspired interactive art elements. The goal is to explore the interplay between interactivity, art, and technology, resulting in an engaging visual experience that reflects on the themes of self-perception and interconnectedness.

### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project stems from Yoko Ono's instruction-based conceptual art. Her works often encourage interaction and reinterpretation, which align with the core ideas of this project: 
- **Reflection:** The mirror effect symbolizes self-reflection and symmetry.
- **Interactivity:** Dynamic shapes and twinkling stars invite user engagement.
- **Instructional Art:** The overlay text, "Imagine yourself reflected in every movement," serves as a conceptual anchor.

### Features
- **Live Camera Feed:** Captures real-time video and displays it on the canvas.
- **Mirror Effect:** Creates a symmetrical reflection of the live feed, emphasizing duality and balance.
- **Dynamic Shapes:** Randomly positioned and animated shapes add an abstract artistic component.
- **Twinkling Stars:** Aesthetic stars introduce a dreamlike quality to the scene.
